# UU-Matter Extended

Ever thought UU-Matter was way too lame? Neither did I.  
UU-Matter Extended adds all sorts of new recipes for the following mods:
- Vanilla Minecraft (slimeball, wool, blaze rods, etc)
- [Applied Energistics 2](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) (certus quartz, more to come...)
